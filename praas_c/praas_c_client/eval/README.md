# PraaS C/C++ enclaves evaluation

This folder houses the scripts that were used to evaluate the system.

1. Make sure the server is running.

2. Make sure you created the static inputs for hashes.

3. Use one of the `load` scripts to trigger runs. Give an output folder, so that the summary file for statistics for each run will be copied to.

4. Use the appropriate `stats_parser` script to obtain the overall statistics of the runs in a given output folder.
